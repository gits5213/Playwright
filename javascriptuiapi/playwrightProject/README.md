## Debugging Tests
    Since Playwright runs in Node.js, you can debug it with your debugger of choice e.g. using console.log or inside your IDE or directly in VS Code with the VS Code Extension. Playwright comes with the Playwright Inspector which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs and explore locators.

## Debugging all tests:
    npx playwright test --debug

## Debugging one test file:
    npx playwright test example.spec.ts --debug

## Debugging a test from the line number where the test(.. is defined:
    npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --debug

# Run a single project
    npx playwright test --project=Smoke

## npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.
